# What is Tenfem?

Tenfem is a Tensorflow + FEM (the Finite Element Method) which 
according to Wikipedia is the "The mostly widely used method for 
solving problems in engineering"<sup>
 [[citation needed]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method)
 </sup>. While there already exist excellent open and closed source
 FEM solving software, this library is introduced to allow a more 
 transparent integration of this software as used by engineers with
more machine learning techniques through the TensorFlow ecosystem.

This project is still in its early stages, and it primarily viewed as
a research tool. We do not intend to achieve the full power of modern
FEM solving software, but we do plan to make it much more 
straight-forward to mix machine learning components with components coming
from a FEM solver, enabling greater collaboration between classical
engineering approaches motivated by fundamental physical principles, and
the flexible, data-driven methods that have fuelled modern machine learning.
